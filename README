LAZERHEAD!!!

This is my first canvas game!
 Heavily inspired by Joshua Marinacci's tutorial at OSCON 2013 (http://www.oscon.com/oscon2013/public/schedule/detail/28823)


The premise is simple:
You a dude with a large lazer for a head and you have avoid
lava balls and large walls to get to the magic door to escape Planet Hades!
You can jump (and jump and jump right now), charge your lazer and fire it!

Controls:
'D' moves you forward
'A' moves you backward
'SPACE' jumps
'J' fires the lazer
'L' charges the lazer

The more powerful your lazer the greater the kickback (and it's even greater in the air)
so becareful not to overcharge or you'll be crushed by lava balls!

Upcoming features:
Larger level (the current one should be very easy to beat)
Sounds! (really want to do all the music through webkit audio)
License (plan to open source this, just need to pick a good license)

Browser:
Since this is a game, for fun, the only browsers I'm supporting is Chrome.

Building:
The files are combined and minified with the closure compiler. If you're
only playing the game there's nothing to see here, but if you want to make
changes make sure you run build.sh (and change the location of the 
compiler.jar if necessary) to generate the minified js file used by the game.
